# Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
Classifying traffic signs using Lenet based convolutional neural network

1. The aim of the prject is to create a classifier to identify traffic signs from teh german dataset
2. Accuracy on validation set must be greater than 93%
3. Accuracy on 5 images downloaded from the internet were also tested
